Utilize Frameworks
Design before Development
Functionality by Plugins
Plug&Play Plugins
package by feature
do not repeat mistakes (doh!)
json or yaml config
file-system persistence (no need for db - write good interface)
adhere SOLID
no more NULL ! (use option)
Functions (method NOT returning void) need to be pure (i.e. not rely on internal state)
Methods that return void change internal state
Make the code sexy af

apache config
slf4j logging (maybe wrapper?)
akka
guice   (declined - maybe for plugins - we'll see)
json/yaml
RabbitMQ (needed?)

Different Devices,
Every device has a facade
Global abstract base-class for facades (maybe?)
Avoid new - use factories
Lua for Plugins - no more compilation necessary
Identify artifacts / devices like this-is-the-artifact (all small letters, separate words by dash)
Commit-comment "Unity" means we have achieved a state where the Coder is happy and homogeneity in code is asserted
Utilize the possibility of several serverquery-connections ! (one for data-getting, one for manipulation, one for events maybe?)
